    <dt>Learning the Basics Part 2</dt>
    <dd>So there is more to creating something than just chaining so we will go over the basic stitches that we will need to make just about any
      project that we could want to make!
    </dd></br>
    <dd>We are going to make a small sample of these next few stitches. You can either make one piece that has all of them together or you can make
      multiple smaller ones. it is up to you. If you are making one piece then when I say chain 10, you can ignore that bit but if the directions say
      chain 11 or 12, you will need to chain the extra stitches to make sure that you have the right number of stitches.</dd>
  </br>
    <dd>Note: the notations in parentesis at the end of the names are the common notations that are used in patterns. These are all done in American
      notations so if you are working on a project that uses a different notation, you will need to remember what their notations are.</dd></br>

    <dd>Chain 11 stitches (yes, you will need to chain 1 more than we are making our block. The extra one is called a turn stitch). The first
      single crochet will go in the second stitch from the hook. Push your hook into the stitch and pick up the yarn pulling it through the first
      loop. You should have 2 loops on your hook now. Pick up the yarn again and this time pull it through both loops on your hook. You should now
      have 1 loop left on your hook. Repeat in the rest of the stitches across your piece.</dd></br>
    <dd>The last stitch can be difficult to spot especially if you made the first chain tight. To fix that simply loosen it a bit and make
      the stitch. At the end of every row, you will make what is called a turning stitch. This stitch or stitches brings you up to the next row
      so that you can continue working. Different stitches will require a different amount of chains. For a single crochet, the turn stitch is
      1 chain. you will always want to work in the same direction and the turning stitch allows you to do this. For right handed people you will
      work from right to left and left handed people will work left the right.</dd></br>
    <dd>When doing another row of single crochet, you will still put your hook in the second stitch, the only difference this time is that it
      will be the first single crochet of the row below. Do the same thing as you did on the last row making singe crochets all the way across
      until you reach the end. Work as many rows as you would like doing this untill you feel comfortable with it. To tie off, After you have
      completed your last single crochet, don't make a turning stitch. Cut the yarn a few inches from your hook and pull it all the way through
      making sure you pull it tight.</dd>

    <dd>Counting Stitches: I have mentioned counting stitches to make sure that you have the right amount. Here I will explain how to actually
      do this. To count stitches, Look at the top edge of your work. Every chain stitch is 1 stitch. When I say to put your hook in the second
      stitch from your hook, you dont count the loop that is around your hook at that moment. You will only count the completed ones.</dd></br>
    <dd>Note: When you are learning, it is a good idea to count at the end of each row to make sure that you didn't skip any or double up on any.</dd></br>
    <dd>Tension: One thing that even people who have been crocheting for a while sometimes struggle with is the tension or tightness of their work.
      The main problem is their work being too tight. To keep this from happening, hold your work near or at the bottom of the stitch you are working
      on. Also keep an eye on how tight the yarn you are pulling is. This can also mess with the tension.</dd>
