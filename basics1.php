    <dt>Learning the Basics</dt>
    <dd>It might seem like there is an insane amount of things that you would
      need to learn before you could try any project. That's not the case! What you need to know is
      how to do just the basic stitches. We will go over all of them right here. If you need a refresher on
      how to do them later you can always come back and look over them again.
    </dd></br>
    <dd>Before you start you will need to pick your yarn and your hook. The sie of the yarn will determine the size of the hook that is needed.
      The thicker that the yarn is the bigger the hook you will need. Most patterns will not give you a specific size yarn to use they will only
      give you an amount of yarn. That is usually done by weight. Most patterns though are done with just normal thickness yarn. The suggested
      size hook to work with this yarn is a 5.5mm hook. You can really use anysize hook that you want. Just use what you think will be comfortable
      for you to hold.</dd>

    <dd>Holding the yarn: While many places suggest having the yarn wrapped around your pinkey and draping it over your pointer finger,
    just do what you find to be most comfortable.</dd></br>
    <dd>Hold yarn in dominant hand a couple of inches from the end. Wrap the yarn around your nondominant pinkey, go up over your two middle fingers,
      behind your pointer finger, bring it over and pinch between your thumb and middle finger. Holding the yarn this way will help keep the tension
      in the yarn and your work consistent through out your project.</dd></br>
    <dd>Holding the hook: I forgot to write down how to do this part!!</dd>

    <dd>CH is the short hand notation for chaing that is found in most patterns. The notations will pop up throughout the projects.
      Once you are holding the yarn in a comfortable way you will lay the hook on the yarn with the hook facing down. Pull the hook down and
      towards yourself and back up, looping the yarn on the hook. *Pinch the bottom of the loop where the yarn overlaps its self and reach your hook
      up to pick up the yarn that runs over your pointer finger. Turn the hook down and pull that yarn through the loop you are pinching. Turn the
      hook so it is face up again. Repeat from the * till you have as many stitches as you need.</dd></br>
    <dd>Note: Don't pull them to tight on your hook or you won't be abe to work in them.</dd>
