    <dt>Learning the Basics Part 3</dt>
    <dd>Most projects are more than just chaining and single crocheting, so lets go over a few more stitches before we get to the projects.
    </dd></br>
    <dd>Again we are going to make a small sample of these next few stitches. You can either make one piece that has all of them together or you can make
      multiple smaller ones. it is up to you. If you are making one piece then when I say chain 10, you can ignore that bit but if the directions say
      chain 11 or 12 or what ever the number may be, you will need to chain the extra stitches to make sure that you have the right number of stitches.</dd>
  </br>
    <dd>Note: the notations in parentesis at the end of the names are the common notations that are used in patterns. These are all done in American
      notations so if you are working on a project that uses a different notation, you will need to remember what their notations are.</dd></br>

    <dd>With a half double crochet you will start out similar to a single crochet. We will start by chaning 12 stitches. The last 2 will be our
      turning stitches. turn your work over and we will start making a half ouble crochet by putting the yarn over the hook and inserting it into
      the thirst stitch from out hook. Pull the yarn over and pull through the first loop. At this point you should have 3 loops on your hook.
      Pull the yarn over again this time pull it through all 3 loops. Continue until you reach the end and have 10 stitches. Chain 2, turn your
      work over and keep practicing untill you are comfortable.

    <dd>With a double crochet we will start by chaining 12 to make our piece 10 wide. This will seem very similar to a half double crochet but
      they are different. To start we will pull the yarn over and insert it into the thirst stitch from the hook. Pull the yarn over again and
      pull it through the first loop. This is where the half double and double crochets differ. As opposed to pulling it you pulling the yarn over and
      through all three loops, we are going to pull the yarn over and only pull it through the first 2 loops on the hook. You should have 2 loops
      on your hook. Pull the yarn over again and pull it through the last 2 loops. Continue till you have 10 stitches. Chain 3, turn your work over
      and keep practicing till you are comfortable.</dd>

  <dd>Triple crochets are the tallest stitch that is used. To make a 10 stitch wide piece, we need to chain 13. This time we are going to wrap
    our yarn around the hook twice. Then we will insert the hook into the forth(?) stitch from our hook. Pick up the yarn and pull it through
    the first loop so that we have 4 loops on our hook. Pull the yarn over and pull it through the first 2 stitches on the hook so that you have
    3 left. Pull the yarn over again and pull it through the next 2 stitches so you have 2 stitches left on your hook. Finally, pull the yarn over
    and pull it through the last 2 stitches. Continue until you have 10 stitches. Chain 4, turn your work over and keep practicing till you are
    comfortable.</dd></br>
  <dd>This is when you will tie off if you have been making one piece with all the stitches. As I said earlier, cut the yarn a few inches from your
    hook and pull it all the way through. Make sure that you pull it tight.</dd>
