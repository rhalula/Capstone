    <h2>What's This About?</h2>
    <p>When people would find out that I knew how to crochet, they would ask one of a couple of questions. The most common
      one is "Can you make this for me?" The second most common question is "Can you teach me?" My response most of the time is
      that I can try but normally it isn't something you can learn all in one sitting. When I was told to come up with ideas for
      what to do my senior project on this is what I thought of: a place that could walk people through learning the basics of
      crocheting.</p></br>
